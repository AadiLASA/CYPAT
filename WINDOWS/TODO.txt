my immediate todo:


look at the shell service scripts
look at v's scripts
combine scripts, add wiper for existing policy
browser configs so no broswer vulns
understand permissions and privelege mangament (how to promote for uninstalls like trusteduninstaller)
how to find instances of elevated priveleges or file shares
fond backdoors with netstat
review mmc and browser settings
review firewall rules
