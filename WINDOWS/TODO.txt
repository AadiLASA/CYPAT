my immediate todo:


look at the shell service scripts
understand permissions and privelege mangament (how to promote for uninstalls like trusteduninstaller)
how to find instances of elevated priveleges or file shares
review firewall rules



TODO FOR SEMIS:
go through stuff from: https://github.com/Adamapb/WIndows_Stuff/blob/main/winscript.ps1
GO THROUGH A CHECKLIST OF CORE WINDOWS UTILITIES THAT MUST BE UP/WORKING BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING AFTER FORENSICS QUESTIONS
making a logging system for everything. Get-FileShare, errors, differences, etc. Go through this in depth later
more cis baselining get every single group policy there is lmfao (go through all there is a lot)
netstat more more more
  find out which pid's are bad
services : black viper is meh revisit (CIS service script is implemented but might need some fine tuning later)
get config files for appsec for common critical applications
secure various ports. learn how to use netstat -ano or other netstat tools to find network backdoors or bad ports)
(IMPORTANT) figure out core issues with system after forensics. you should understand the general problems and make a plan of attack before even beginning scripts
PRACTICE WITH THE EVENT VIEWER / ID LIST TO FIND IMPORTANT CHANGES
learn about appsec for common tools
ORGANIZE THE FOLDER SKULL
update checklist with more indepth step by step.
  optimize it for speed
  do runs in different VMs
  have fallback for after completion
check for cross user directory permissions


literally go through all cis for the rest of group policy for obscure settings
once everything is done start actually learning how things work so you can tepuvlefix service or malware issues youâ€™re gonna destroy vedanth and gideon
go through aperture for advice
personally configure some hidden files deep in user directories and see if sus finder can get it
remember the shares. only three allowed shares are on the checklist. also look for drive sharing
with new script make sure to re-paste in registries you added to the scriptAutoRun (reg add "HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer" /v "DisableNotificationCenter" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f)



MOST IMPORTANT ULTRA:
make sure scripts are all working well out the box from single runnable powershell file. I should just make directory, passwords txt, different logs, and I should be done
Make it so you can run one thing and every script gets set up
go through GPT fixes onc checklist and ask everything about windows to learn how everything works
