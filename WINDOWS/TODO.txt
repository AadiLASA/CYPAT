my immediate todo:

fix reverse-shell
look at the shell service scripts
look at v's scripts
maybe improve file extension script
combine scripts, add wiper for existing policy
wtf is service manager
browser configs so no broswer vulns
put as many solutions into document
fully finish user automation
understand permissions and privelege mangament (how to promote for uninstalls like trusteduninstaller)
