my immediate todo:

review firewall rules

TODO FOR SEMIS:
test scripts again
registry baseline
  examining configured GPOs on the challenge image or comparing default Windows folder permissions with those harvested during competition.
create necessary utilities checklist (pre script, winfirewall service running, proper permissions, etc.)
make list of services that must be up and running before script
retry heist image -> check if dlls actually broken. try actually doing in order so fixing malware stuff before script and try fixing firewall with psexec. in startup registry key find out what the actual exec was.
configure service on/off tool. remember what you learned about ftp
go into depth about net firewalls?
  possbily blocking port 21 for ftp if not allowed or smth like that
learn how the windows file system actually works
make the appsec file and start adding stuff to it. first find out all crit services from old messages in the server. 
  appsec is also app auto updates and app permissions ontop of secure settings
  find out how to develop a method that would consistently flag all manually installed packages on the system.
wtf the audit poplicies aren't in the gpo. manually do the setaudit policy thing from the OG policy script --> take it out of policy wiper lmfao
move the appmgmt order so it's, uninstall, update, install
fix errors with scriptAutoRun and script as a whole.
apply the other registry changes
GO THROUGH A CHECKLIST OF CORE WINDOWS UTILITIES THAT MUST BE UP/WORKING BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING AFTER FORENSICS QUESTIONS
netstat more more more
  find out which pid's are bad
get config files for appsec for common critical applications
LOOK THROUGH SERVICES AGAIN
secure various ports. learn how to use netstat -ano or other netstat tools to find network backdoors or bad ports)
(IMPORTANT) figure out core issues with system after forensics. you should understand the general problems and make a plan of attack before even beginning scripts
PRACTICE WITH THE EVENT VIEWER / ID LIST TO FIND IMPORTANT CHANGES
have fallback for after completion
once everything is done start actually learning how things work so you can tepuvlefix service or malware issues youâ€™re gonna destroy vedanth and gideon
Are there any ports I should straight up block for connections? How do I harden my windows 10 machine network wise
look at insecure drivers
look at insecure DLLs
man tf up and do all the images once these are all done.
