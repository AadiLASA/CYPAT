my immediate todo:


look at the shell service scripts
look at v's scripts
combine scripts, add wiper for existing policy
browser configs so no broswer vulns
understand permissions and privelege mangament (how to promote for uninstalls like trusteduninstaller)
how to find instances of elevated priveleges or file shares
fond backdoors with netstat
review mmc and browser settings
review firewall rules



TODO FOR SEMIS
fix user auditing script asap
more cis baselining get every single group policy there is lmfao
netstat more more more
  find out which pid's are bad
services : config blackviper's settings + reverse setting strategy 
find out about prohib files
get config files for appsec for common critical applications
(IMPORTANT) learn the important audits for event viewer [what is the IDs for make file, change audits, change all the policies, change important settings, change firewall rules, etc.
secure various ports. learn how to use netstat -ano or other netstat tools to find network backdoors or bad ports)
(IMPORTANT) figure out core issues with system after forensics. you should understand the general problems and make a plan of attack before even beginning scripts
