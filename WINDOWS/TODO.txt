my immediate todo:


look at the shell service scripts
look at v's scripts
combine scripts, add wiper for existing policy
browser configs so no broswer vulns
understand permissions and privelege mangament (how to promote for uninstalls like trusteduninstaller)
how to find instances of elevated priveleges or file shares
fond backdoors with netstat
review mmc and browser settings
review firewall rules



TODO FOR SEMIS
fix user auditing script asap
more cis baselining get every single group policy there is lmfao (go through all there is a lot)
netstat more more more
  find out which pid's are bad
services : black viper is meh revisit (CIS service script is implemented but might need some fine tuning later)
find out about prohib files
get config files for appsec for common critical applications
secure various ports. learn how to use netstat -ano or other netstat tools to find network backdoors or bad ports)
(IMPORTANT) figure out core issues with system after forensics. you should understand the general problems and make a plan of attack before even beginning scripts
