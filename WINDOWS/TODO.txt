TODO FOR SEMIS:
implement the following powershell script

function Enable-PSScriptBlockLogging
{
    $basePath = 'HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows' +
      '\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging'

    if(-not (Test-Path $basePath))
    {
        $null = New-Item $basePath -Force
    }

    Set-ItemProperty $basePath -Name EnableScriptBlockLogging -Value "1"
}


It is possible to detect GPO modifications by monitoring directory service changes using Windows event logs. Several events may be logged for such GPO modifications, including:
  Event ID 5136 Event ID 5137 Event ID 5138 Event ID 5139 Event ID 5141 
signature scanning
    possible dependency baselining
    research ntfs stuff how to delete what is bad
    learn how to get DLLs to stop
    remember registry autorun stuff
    finish registry sam stuff
    get better AV
    previous file version history
security task manager
some more good stuff : https://gist.github.com/mackwage/08604751462126599d7e52f233490efe?permalink_comment_id=4028081
ensure firewlal is not in passive mode
test user auditing again
finish up the appsec
find way to check/valudate file signatures and hashing and search for easy ways to find poisoned dlls or packages
https://github.com/simeononsecurity/Standalone-Windows-STIG-Script -> look at this dudes stuff
take pics of default processes running from procaxplorer and autoruns to badeline during comp
TCP-VIEW SYSINTERNALS, SIGCHECK, ACCESSENUM, REGSCANNER
ensure netsh stuff is there and netsh reset
hosts file...
get secure adapter/port settings
make sure important windows settings are covered
elaborate on winchecklist and create timestamps for everything
come back to this for registry baseline : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W_3wnjvj5c
analyze the sysinternals autoruns, netstat/backdoor stuff from tirefire and john, procmon/hacker, look at network scanning tools like wireshark. also about accessENUM
script windows defender manually because LGPO can't do it
review nirsoft tools and keep working on checklist from security tips
how to secure the network settings
learn about SAM (security account manager)
  also into stuff like hidden users and weird stuff
test scripts again
look into nessus tool??
registry baseline
  examining configured GPOs on the challenge image or comparing default Windows folder permissions with those harvested during competition.
make list of services that must be up and running before script
retry heist image -> check if dlls actually broken. try actually doing in order so fixing malware stuff before script and try fixing firewall with psexec. in startup registry key find out what the actual exec was.
configure service on/off tool. remember what you learned about ftp
go into depth about net firewalls?
  possbily blocking port 21 for ftp if not allowed or smth like that
  secure various ports. learn how to use netstat -ano or other netstat tools to find network backdoors or bad ports)
learn how the windows file system actually works
make the appsec file and start adding stuff to it. first find out all crit services from old messages in the server. 
  appsec is also app auto updates and app permissions ontop of secure settings
  find out how to develop a method that would consistently flag all manually installed packages on the system.
apply the other registry changes
GO THROUGH A CHECKLIST OF CORE WINDOWS UTILITIES THAT MUST BE UP/WORKING BEFORE STARTING ANYTHING AFTER FORENSICS QUESTIONS
get config files for appsec for common critical applications
LOOK THROUGH SERVICES AGAIN
(IMPORTANT) figure out core issues with system after forensics. you should understand the general problems and make a plan of attack before even beginning scripts
PRACTICE WITH THE EVENT VIEWER / ID LIST TO FIND IMPORTANT CHANGES
look at insecure drivers
look at insecure DLLs
