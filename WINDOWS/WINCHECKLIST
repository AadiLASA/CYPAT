USE EVENT VIEWER Use Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) can provide logs that might indicate what processes or scripts are being executed at logon.
===========================================================================================================================================================================================
    Security Logs
        These logs can provide information about login attempts, changes to security settings, and other security-related activities. Look for any unusual patterns or entries around the times you suspect Group Policy settings were modified.
    System Logs
        System logs contain events logged by the operating system components. These can include system errors, warnings, and informational events, some of which may be related to Group Policy changes.
    Application Logs
        These logs hold events logged by applications. If a specific application is responsible for modifying Group Policy settings, you might find relevant entries here.
    Group Policy Operational Logs
        Located under "Applications and Services Logs" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "GroupPolicy" -> "Operational". This log specifically tracks Group Policy processing and can be very useful in identifying when and how Group Policy was applied or refreshed.
Event IDs to Look For
    Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can help track execution of scripts or programs).
    Event ID 4738: A user account was changed (might indicate changes in user privileges or settings).
    Event ID 4720: A user account was created (useful if new accounts are being made for malicious purposes).
    Event ID 4704: A user right was assigned (can indicate changes in user rights, which could relate to Group Policy changes).
