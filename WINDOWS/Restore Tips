POWERSHELL
        Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter.
        Navigate to User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System.
        Find and double-click on Don't run specified Windows applications.
        Set it to Disabled or Not Configured.
        Navigate to Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Windows PowerShell.
        Ensure Turn on Script Execution is set to Enabled and configure the execution policy as needed (e.g., Allow all scripts).

MMC
        Still in Group Policy Editor, navigate to User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System.
        Find settings related to the specific tools you want to enable (like MMC restrictions) and set them to Disabled or Not Configured.



MALICIOUS AUTOSTART AFFECTING Group Policy or malicious autostarts in general

1. Check Startup Programs

    Use the Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to review the list of startup programs. Look for any unfamiliar or suspicious applications that might be related to the reapplication of Group Policy.
    You can disable any suspicious startup items from here.

2. Examine Scheduled Tasks

    Open Task Scheduler (taskschd.msc) and check for any tasks that are set to run at logon or at regular intervals that might be responsible for applying Group Policy settings.
    Look for tasks with actions involving scripting tools or policy-related commands.

3. Inspect Scripts in Common Startup Locations

    Check common script locations such as C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp or the Startup folder in the user's profile.
    Also, check the registry keys for startup scripts: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.

4. Use System Configuration (msconfig)

    Run msconfig to access System Configuration. Check the Services and Startup tabs for any unusual entries.

5. Review Group Policy Scripts

    If you have access, check Group Policy scripts that might be applied. Look under Computer Configuration or User Configuration in the Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc) for any startup scripts.

6. Conduct a Malware Scan

    Perform a thorough scan of your system using a reliable antivirus or anti-malware program. Malicious software could be responsible for reapplying these policies.

7. Monitor with Sysinternals Tools

    Use tools from the Sysinternals Suite like Process Explorer or Autoruns to get a more detailed view of what's running on your system and what's configured to run at startup.

8. Use Event Viewer

    The Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) can provide logs that might indicate what processes or scripts are being executed at logon.

To investigate potential reapplication of Group Policy settings or other suspicious activities, certain logs within the Event Viewer can be particularly helpful. Here are the relevant ones:
Event Viewer Logs to Check

    Security Logs
        These logs can provide information about login attempts, changes to security settings, and other security-related activities. Look for any unusual patterns or entries around the times you suspect Group Policy settings were modified.

    System Logs
        System logs contain events logged by the operating system components. These can include system errors, warnings, and informational events, some of which may be related to Group Policy changes.

    Application Logs
        These logs hold events logged by applications. If a specific application is responsible for modifying Group Policy settings, you might find relevant entries here.

    Group Policy Operational Logs
        Located under "Applications and Services Logs" -> "Microsoft" -> "Windows" -> "GroupPolicy" -> "Operational". This log specifically tracks Group Policy processing and can be very useful in identifying when and how Group Policy was applied or refreshed.

Event IDs to Look For

    Event ID 4688: A new process has been created (can help track execution of scripts or programs).
    Event ID 4738: A user account was changed (might indicate changes in user privileges or settings).
    Event ID 4720: A user account was created (useful if new accounts are being made for malicious purposes).
    Event ID 4704: A user right was assigned (can indicate changes in user rights, which could relate to Group Policy changes).
